# DNA - Database Neutral Access

Simple Database wrapper for Go. It works somewhat like an ORM, but I think it's too much simple to call it an ORM.

This package was originally called HashSqlite, but this name caused some confusion driving people to think that there was some kind of hash function involved.
Also it has attached the project to Sqlite. It is a fact that it only wraps Sqlite now, but other databases may be wrapped by DNA in the future.
